# CloudApp
Cloud App for Windows based on ssh protocol.

Cloud App was born as a project for personal use and needs, but I decided to publish it because I found it useful in different contexts.
CloudApp is written in python in a single file, to facilitate its conversion to .exe via the PYInstaller module.
The application is based on the ssh and sftp protocols to communicate with the server (a Linux server is required) to provide the classic services of a File Manager such as upload, downlad, copy, paste ...
The application uses multithreding to manage different execution flows.

Since the project is not a project for personal use, the code is very vertical and not extremely clear, I will update it with new versions.


Installation and usage will come soon...
